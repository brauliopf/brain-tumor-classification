Train machine learning models to classify brain tumors from MRI scans.
The application uses different prediction models, based on NN, to diagnose from the images provided. In addition to that, the application engages multi-modal LLMs to understand and explain the model's predictions.

Train a deep learning model (1) leverging an existing model (transfer learning) and another model using(2) a custom convolutional neural network architecture.
Create a webapp with streamlit to generate predictions usign the models generated in part 1; visualize which areas of the scans are important to reach the predictions; and provide an explanation for the conclusions based on the observations from the MRI scan.
Furthermore, the application suggests relevant actions to add to a patient's care plan in the short-term.

The app is available at: https://brain-tumor-classifier-brauliopf.streamlit.app/
